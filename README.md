# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


I created an online apparel design portfolio for my Project0.
The project contains 4 HTML pages, an SCSS stylesheet page, a CSS stylesheet page converted from the SCSS, and images.

The Home/index HTML page includes a navigation bar (using unordered list), page title, and an image from my portfolio.

The Projects HTML page includes navigation bar, page title, Bootstrap grids (visible in large screens), and images of my apparel design work.

The Resume HTML page includes navigation bar, page title, and Bootstrap grids (visible in large screens).

The Contact page includes navigation bar, page title, a table, a text area (cannot actually submit anything), and a Bootstrap button.

Each HTML page contains an @media query. I attempted to include the @media query in my SCSS/CSS stylesheet, but the code never works there.
But when I put it inside the <style></style> section of my HTML head, it always works fine.

I also attempted to add SCSS variables and nest inside the CSS stylesheet, but discovered that it is not possible.
Thus I transferred all my CSS code into an SCSS format, and re-converted the SCSS into CSS.
